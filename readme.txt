SUMMARY AND HISTORY
Sharp Checkers is a checkers game written using the Model View Presenter (MVP) pattern.  I
wrote this some time ago and recently ran into it on my computer.  I initially created it
over the course of one week to experiment with the MVP design pattern.  Up until today, it
was a throwaway project but now I realize it can be expanded upon and used as a learning
tool for myself and others.

Sharp Checkers is nowhere near as feature rich as my old hit, Maverick Checkers, which was
written in Java.  At the time I published Maverick Checkers, it was the strongest and most
feature rich Java application available on the web based upon my web searches and some
reviews articles I found on the web.  Maverick Checkers can be run as a standalone
application or through a browser.  I've included the Maverick Checkers application and
screenshots in the source control repository as a point of reference
(~/resources/MaverickCheckers).

Over time, I hope others will extend this project with more features so that it surpasses
Maverick Checkers.


FUTURE WORK
- Port this app to various technologies on the Microsoft stack such as Silverlight and WPF
- Port to Microsoft Surface
- Implement most of the features in Maverick Checkers
- Add more move engines using the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)
- Port to .NET Framework 4.0
